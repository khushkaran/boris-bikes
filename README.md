Boris Bikes
---

Boris Bikes was the week 3 project, based on the London Boris Bikes initiative. Users can collect and dock bikes, however, bikes can break in which case they need repairing, involving the collection of bikes by a van. They are taken to the garage, once repaired are collected again and dropped off at the docking station.

Project was developed heavily using TDD.
